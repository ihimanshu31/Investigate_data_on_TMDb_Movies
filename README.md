# Udacity- Data Analyst Nanodegree 
Project 2 - Investigate_data_on_TMDb_Movies
Working on ( TMDb Dataset )


Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it.
You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis
code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

Introduction :
The TMDb movie dataset provide many information on all movies. The data contains
information that are provided from The Movie Database (TMDb). It collects 5000+ movies
basic move information and movie matrices, including user ratings, popularity and revenue
data. These metrics can be seen as how successful these movies are. The movie basic
information contained like cast, director, keywords, runtime, genres, etc.

The primary goal of the project is to go through the general data analysis process — using
basic data analysis technique with NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. It contains three parts:
1. Data Wrangling
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Conclusion

In this report I am going to explore following questions :

Question 1: Which movies are the most profitable to the market?
Question 2: Which movie has the Least and maximum profit, budget, runtime?
Question 3: Top 10 movies by profit, budget, and runtime?
Question 4: Which years do movies made the most profits?
Question 5: Movie Release year’s vs Total budget made by movies?
Question 6: No. of movies release in every month of a year?
Question 7: Find the top casts, directors and genres?
Question 8: What is the Average Budget of the movies?
Question 9: What is the Average Revenue earned by the movies?
Question 10: What is the Average duration of the movies
