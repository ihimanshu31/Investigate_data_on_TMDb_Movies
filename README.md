# Udacity- Data Analyst Nanodegree 
Project 2 - Investigate_data_on_TMDb_Movies
Working on ( TMDb Dataset )


Project Overview:

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it.
You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.
You'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis
code in Python a lot easier! 

Introduction :

The TMDb movie dataset provide many information on all movies. The data contains
information that are provided from The Movie Database (TMDb). It collects 5000+ movies
basic move information and movie matrices, including user ratings, popularity and revenue
data. These metrics can be seen as how successful these movies are. The movie basic
information contained like cast, director, keywords, runtime, genres, etc.

The primary goal of the project is to go through the general data analysis process — using
basic data analysis technique with NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. It contains three parts:
  1. Data Wrangling
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis
  3. Conclusion

In this Project I am going to explore following questions :

    Question 1: Which movies are the most profitable to the market?
    Question 2: Which movie has the Least and maximum profit, budget, runtime?
    Question 3: Top 10 movies by profit, budget, and runtime?
    Question 4: Which years do movies made the most profits?
    Question 5: Movie Release year’s vs Total budget made by movies?
    Question 6: No. of movies release in every month of a year?
    Question 7: Find the top casts, directors and genres?
    Question 8: What is the Average Budget of the movies?
    Question 9: What is the Average Revenue earned by the movies?
    Question 10: What is the Average duration of the movies
    
Final Conclusions:

This was a very interesting data analysis. We came out with some very interesting facts about
movies. After this analysis we can conclude following:

**For a Movie to be in successful criteria**

     Average Budget must be around 60 million dollar
     Average duration of the movie must be 113 minutes (1 hr 53min)
     Profits: profits has positive relationship with budget and popularity
     Any one of these should be in the cast: Robert De Niro , Bruce Willis, Sylvester
      Stallone, Samuel L. Jackson.
     Genre must be: Comedy, Drama. Action, Thriller.
     Director must be: Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, Ridley Scott, and Woody Allen.
